# DSE informal blog

A place for DSE folks to informally share knowledge.

**Incomplete work is encouraged!** Please open a PR even if you're not ready to post;
sometimes getting a second or third pair of eyes on your work can help get it ready
faster and with higher quality!

## Our tool choice

We started with Quarto because running inline code is likely important for our authors.

We considered MyST, but it currently lacks support for a blogging user experience. We
will switch to MyST once it ticks all our boxes!

- [ ] Blogging / listing pages.
